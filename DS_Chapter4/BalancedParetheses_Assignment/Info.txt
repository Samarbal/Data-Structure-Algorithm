Project Title:
Balanced Parentheses Checker Using Stack (Linked List)

Project Description:
This project implements a Stack data structure from scratch using
a Linked List. The stack is used to check whether a mathematical
expression has balanced parentheses.

Supported brackets:
- Parentheses: ()
- Curly braces: {}
- Square brackets: []

How the program works:
1. Opening brackets are pushed into the stack.
2. Closing brackets are matched with the top of the stack.
3. If a mismatch occurs or the stack is empty when a closing bracket
   is found, the expression is not balanced.
4. If the stack is empty at the end, the expression is balanced.

Technologies Used:
- Java
- Linked List
- Stack (LIFO)
